It identifies high-spending regions, compares shopping trends between younger and older customers, examines how purchase frequency and seasonal patterns affect spending, evaluates the impact of discounts and promo codes, and explores which payment and shipping options are most preferred. The findings help businesses understand customer behavior more deeply and make data-driven decisions to improve sales strategies and customer engagement.",

        detailedDescription: 'This dashboard was created for Job Seekers, Job Transtioners, and Job Sweepers to solve a common problem: information about the data job market is scattered and hard to grasp. Using a real-world dataset of 2024 data science job posting (Including titles, salaries, and locations), this project provides a single, easy-to-use interface to explore market trends and compernsation. I made this dashboard as part of a learning tutorial was going through',
        conclusion: 'This dashboard showcases how Power BI can transform raw job posting data into a powerful tool for career analysis. It allows users to slice, filter, and drill through data to make informed decisions about their career path.',
