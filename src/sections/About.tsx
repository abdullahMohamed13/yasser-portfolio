                Hi, I'm Yasser Allam, a <strong> Data Analyst </strong> with a Bachelor's degree in Systems and Information.
                I enjoy working with tools like
                <strong> Power BI</strong>, 
                <strong> SQL</strong>, 
                <strong> Excel</strong>, 
                <strong> Power Query</strong>, 
                <strong> DAX</strong>,
                and
                <strong> GitHub </strong>
                to turn raw data
                into meaningful insights.

            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                I've already built several projects
                (<a className="underline text-primary" href="#projects">check them out below ðŸ‘‡</a>)
                that showcase my ability to analyze,
                visualize, and present data in a clear and impactful way. My goal is to help businesses make smarter
                decisions through data, while continuously growing my skills and exploring new technologies in the data
                field.
